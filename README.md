Google Analytics
=============

Google Analytics as per the Collection Protocol. Specifically useful for MXit.

- cURL-less
- Autohit
- Include and forget

This is v0.1, and it's super basic.. I plan to have a look at this and improve it later on.

## Usage

Open `googleanalytics.php` and edit your UA code, then..

```php
require_once("googleanalytics.php");
```

Easy as pie.
